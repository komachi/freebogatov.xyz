              <h2>What is he accused of?</h2>
              <p><strong>The prosecution believes that Bogatov posted extremist materials in the internet.</strong></p>
              <p>He is accused of part 2 of <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_10699/5cd3ab84099ba6d7c54795ca046fce3da68b70b5/" target="_blank">article 205.2 of Russian Criminal code</a> (incitement of terrorist activities or justifying terrorism via the Internet), part 1 of <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_10699/da2816304405597f50919c18f77906b4bf4594c3/" target="_blank">article 30</a>, part 1 of <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_10699/cdfbaa9aeaf8b47695af18e41433e4e3f5f4be5f/" target="_blank">article 212</a> (arrangement of preparation of mass riots).</p>
              <p>According to the case, somebody posted 2 messages on website sysadmins.ru on 29 March. Airat Bashirov accessed his account from 104 different IP adresses located in different countries, including Dmitry Bogatov's IP address.</p>
              <p>To substantiate the need of Bogatov's arrest investigator pointed to video showing "mass riots and police disobedience". The only one video posted by Airat Bashirov is <a href="https://youtu.be/FJt7gNi3Nr4" target="_blank">a music clip of hip-hop performers</a> Kanye West and Jay-Z "No Church in The Wild".</p>
              <p>Need of arrest also was substantiated by the fact that Dmitry planned to visit Italy on 12 April. At that time Italy hosted <a href="http://iej.esperanto.it/ijf" target="_blank">International Esperanto Youth Festival</a>, which Dmitry planned to visit beforehand with his wife.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-pad">
              <h2>Why is he innocent?</h2>
              <p><strong>Dmitry Bogatov didn't post messages in posting which he is accused of. He ran a Tor exit relay, which is not illegal in Russia, and he's not charged with that.</strong></p>
              <p>Dmitry Bogatov was a operator of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)" target="_blank">Tor</a> exit relay. Tor is a special software which routes Internet traffic over random circuits builded from servers located around the world. Exit relays are used as last servers in circuit, that's why their adresses appears in logs. Dmitry's relay was online last time at 5 April 2017.</p>
              <p>Airat Bashirov also used Tor network for posting messages for posting which Dmitry is accused.</p>
              <p>After Dmitry's arrest, Airat Bashirov continue to post messages. News outlets "Open Russia" and "Mediazona" even <a href="https://openrussia.org/notes/708408/" target="_blank">got a chance to speak with him</a>. In a comment to the Mediazona he confirmed that he used Tor.</p>
              <p>At the time when Bashirov's messages were posted Dmitry was not at home. He went to a fitness club with his wife, after which he visited a grocery store. That's confirmed by CCTV footage.</p>
              <p>Now Dmitry is under house arrest, he has no right to use Internet and telephone. He risks 19 years of prison. We continue the struggle and need your help to release Dmitry!</p>

              <h2>Run a Tor relay with nickname that contains Bogatov or KAction in solidarity.</h2>
              <p>Tor activists have <a href="https://blog.torservers.net/20170414/tor-exit-node-operator-arrested-in-russia-a-solidarity-tor-relay-challenge-launched.html" target="_blank">launched a flashmob</a> on April 12 and call all Tor relay administrators to run or rename their relays using #freeBogatov or #KAction. </p>
              <p>Tor Project website <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-relay-debian.html.en" target="_blank">has a guide</a> on how to do it. You can run relay at your home (In that case it recommended to not run an exit relay, but middle relay, that way no negative activity will come from your IP.</p>
              <p>You can also limit bandwidth if you don't want to give full bandwidth to the Tor network) or rent a server. <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/GoodBadISPs" target="_blank">Here is a list</a> of hosters tried by activists who are running Tor relays. As for April 18, 45 relays and exit nodes have been launched in solidarity with Dmitry. See <a href="https://atlas.torproject.org/#search/bogatov" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://atlas.torproject.org/#search/kaction" target="_blank">here</a> to view the lists of relays.</p>

            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>Finally I am able to express my gratitude to everyone who supported campaign in my defense. It is impressive how wide it had spread across the globe, up to the places I would never expect to follow the news from Russia. You sent me postcards and letters, keeping my faith that one day the horror will end and I will be again in the Free Software community, at home.  Many of you have never got a benefit from my work, still spent your time and your work to take action in my support. You gave me geography lessons by pictures from #freebogatov flashmob. You donated money to cover expenses. You made my case very public, to visible annoyance of officials. Thank you!</p>
            <p>I would not dare to list anyone personally, for the list would be woefully incomplete; but you know yourself that you brought a piece of justice and hope into the world.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this is not the end of the story, I still need your help. At least, now I can email.</p>
